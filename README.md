# 👋 Hey, I'm Paul

I'm a self-taught Python developer from Nakuru, Kenya, blending technical skill with emotional depth. I build interactive tools, educational games, and personal growth apps that help people reflect, learn, and grow — just like I did.

## 🧠 What Drives Me
I believe code can be more than functional — it can be *healing*. My projects often channel personal experiences into creative tools that spark insight and emotional growth.

## 🛠️ Current Projects
- 🎮 **Hangman GUI** — A playful twist on the classic game, built with tkinter and turtle graphics.
- 📊 **Personal Growth Tracker** — A digital diary that tracks moods, milestones, and reflections.
- 🔍 **Tutor Data Analyzer** — Smart search and filtering tools for educational insights.
- 🧠 **Rock-Paper-Scissors GUI** — A fun, interactive game with clean design and responsive feedback.

## 🧰 Skills & Tools
- Python (file I/O, dictionaries, functions, GUI with tkinter & turtle)
- Data parsing and visualization
- Emotional UX design
- Reflective writing and storytelling

## 🌱 My Journey
I started learning Python to rebuild myself after heartbreak — and discovered a passion for creating tools that help others do the same. Every project I build is a step toward healing, growth, and purpose.
